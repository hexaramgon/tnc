/**
 * Abstract file / class definition for common API implemention classes
 * Makes it possible to unify every API under one interface.
 *
 * Before implementing any instance of this interface, make sure you
 *  1. DO NOT, again DO NOT hard-code API keys into the code
 *  2. if there's a required API ID / key pair, put them in the member variables
 *      and as parameters of the class constructor
 *  3. No raw string data should be returned, instead return objects,
 *      you can define parameter / return types yourself.
